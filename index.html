		<h2>Simspon Wannabe</h2>
		<p>Wolfcastle is a parody of bodybuilder, actor and politician Arnold Schwarzenegger.</p>
		<p>The character was originally referred to both within the show and by the production team as McBain, taken from the role he portrayed in the fictional action film franchise. However, for a short time, The Simpsons could not use the McBain name because a movie of the same name (unrelated to The Simpsons character) was released in 1991. During this time, the movie's producers refused to give Twentieth Century Fox and Matt Groening's production company clearance to use the "McBain" name, so the name of Rainier Wolfcastle was used to sidestep this. Later, the use of "McBain" as both Wolfcastle's alter-ego and continuing series of films returned to the show. He is an overpaid portrayer of action hero, McBain. His biggest theatrical stretch is playing Radioactive Man.</p>
